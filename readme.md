Useful in order to accord Windows theme color to your screen wallpaper:

* right click your windows desktop => personalization => colors => custom color => more 
* select the edit field with '#' character and ctrl+v to copy the color chosen (the script fill your clipboard with the color code) and confirm the modification

A side effect of this little script is understanding how bad some monitor are at displaying colors depending on the view angle,
don't be fooled! move the color window in different area of your monitor to appreciate the huge disparities between the up left corner of your screen and 
the bottom.
